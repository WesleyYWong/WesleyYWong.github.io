### About me

I am a person who likes to code and make fun and dumb projects that do any number of things, some pointless and some not.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/WesleyYWong/WesleyYWong.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
